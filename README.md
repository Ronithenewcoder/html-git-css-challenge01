First Challenge for class
The purpose of this assignment is to make the code/markup more readable and accessible. 
How I made this website's code more readable and accessible is by changing the markup to semantic, where other developers can understand it and adding descriptive language to pictures. I also grouped classes together in style css to improve the code without changing what it does.
